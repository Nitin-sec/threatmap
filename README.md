# 🛡 ThreatMap Infra

> AI-assisted VAPT & External Attack Surface Management (EASM) scanner for professional penetration testers.

ThreatMap Infra automates the reconnaissance and vulnerability scanning phases of a pentest, then produces a formatted Excel report with AI-generated triage for every finding.  It is designed to run on **Kali Linux** and works fully offline with no AI configuration required.

---

## Features

| Category | What it does |
|---|---|
| **Recon** | Subdomain enumeration (Subfinder), live host filtering (httpx) |
| **Scanning** | Nmap (ports + services), WhatWeb (tech stack), Nikto (web vulns), Gobuster (dirs), SSLScan (TLS) |
| **Parallelism** | All hosts scanned concurrently via `ThreadPoolExecutor` (2–4 workers) |
| **Evidence** | HTTP probes (status, title, security headers), optional EyeWitness screenshots |
| **AI Triage** | Rule-based by default; upgrades to Groq / OpenAI / Ollama via env vars |
| **Reporting** | Colour-coded Excel report (Cover, Findings, Evidence sheets) + HTML evidence gallery |
| **Database** | SQLite — all results persisted across runs |

---

## Requirements

### System tools (install on Kali)

```bash
sudo apt install -y nmap nikto gobuster sslscan whatweb
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/subfinder/v2/cmd/subfinder@latest
go install -v github.com/projectdiscovery/httpx/cmd/httpx@latest
```

### Python

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-org/ThreatMap-Infra.git
cd ThreatMap-Infra
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Usage

```bash
python main.py
```

You will be prompted for:
1. Target domain or URL
2. Authorization confirmation (required)
3. Scan mode (full subdomain sweep or targeted single-host)
4. Worker count (1–4)

Scan output is silenced to `reports/scan.log` during the run.  The terminal shows a clean progress display.

### Output files

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `Findings.xlsx` | Colour-coded Excel report (Cover + Findings + Evidence) |
| `reports/evidence_report.html` | Self-contained HTML screenshot gallery |
| `reports/scan.log` | Full verbose scan output for review |
| `threatmap.db` | SQLite database (persists between runs) |

## AI-Powered Triage (Optional)

ThreatMap Infra works **fully without any AI configuration**.  The rule-based engine handles severity scoring, CVSS mapping, and remediation templates automatically.

To enable AI-enhanced triage, set one of the following before running:

### Option A — Groq (Free, Recommended)

Get a free key at [console.groq.com](https://console.groq.com) — no credit card needed.

```bash
export THREATMAP_LLM_PROVIDER=groq
export THREATMAP_LLM_API_KEY=gsk_your_key_here
```

### Option B — OpenAI

```bash
pip install openai
export THREATMAP_LLM_PROVIDER=openai
export THREATMAP_LLM_API_KEY=sk-your_key_here
```

### Option C — Local Ollama (Advanced / Air-gapped)

```bash
# Requires Ollama running: https://ollama.ai
export THREATMAP_LLM_PROVIDER=ollama
export THREATMAP_LLM_MODEL=llama3   # optional, defaults to llama3
```

If Ollama is configured but not reachable, the tool automatically falls back to rule-based triage with no crash.

| User type | Config | Works? |
|---|---|---|
| No config | Nothing | ✅ Full functionality, rule-based triage |
| Free user | Groq key (2 min setup) | ✅ AI-enhanced, free |
| Enterprise | OpenAI key | ✅ AI-enhanced, their infra |
| Air-gapped | Ollama running | ✅ Fully local |
| Ollama off | Ollama configured but down | ✅ Auto-fallback to rules |

---

## Screenshots (Optional)

Install EyeWitness for visual evidence capture:

```bash
# Option 1 — pip
pip install eyewitness

# Option 2 — git clone (more up to date)
git clone https://github.com/FortyNorthSecurity/EyeWitness ~/EyeWitness
```

If EyeWitness is not found, the evidence layer falls back to HTTP probes (status code, page title, security header audit) which are stored as structured JSON and linked in the Excel report.

## What Is NOT in Scope (v1.0)

The following are deliberately excluded to keep the tool practical and maintainable:

- **Docker containerisation** — adds friction for a CLI pentest tool; native Kali install is faster
- **Web UI / dashboard** — out of scope for v1.0; consider this a v2 feature
- **Plugin architecture** — premature abstraction; add when there are 3+ community plugins to justify it
- **Nuclei / automated exploit integration** — scope creep; ThreatMap is a reconnaissance tool
- **CVE auto-exploitation** — out of scope entirely; this is a VAPT assistant, not an exploit framework
